# Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algoirithm Class - Revised
**BFOA** This library contains the SwarmPackagePy python library with the extended BFOA algorithms and its variants.<br>

Provides:<br>
- Bacterial Foraging Optimization algorithms.
- Test functions for swarm algorithms.
- Animation of minimum find process.<br>
<br>Every algorithm has arguments listed below:<br>
- **n**: number of agents
- **function**: test function
- **lb**: lower limits for plot axes
- **ub**: upper limits for plot axes
- **dimension**: space dimension
- **iteration**: number of iterations
- **Nre**: Number of reproductions
- **Ned**: Number of elimination-disposal steps
- **Da**: Depth of attractant
- **Hr**: Heith of repellent
- **Wa**: Width/Rate of attractant
- **Wr**: Width/Rate of repellent
- **lamda**: Variant constant
